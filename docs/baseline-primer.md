# Baseline Primer

* Establish terms so we know we are talking about the same thing when we say a word.

* **Probability** - *P* - the likelihood that an event will occur
  * If *p* = 0, the event will not occur.
  * If *p* = 1, the event will occur.
* **Law of Large Numbers** - the frequency of an event will converge on the probability of the event as the number of trials increase.
* **Mutually Exclusive** - two events cannot occur at the same time.
* **Random Variable** - a variable with a vaule that determined by a chance event.
  * **Discrete Variable** - variables that can only be certain values, within a range. For example, the number of heads from *n* coin flips is a whole number between 0 and *n*. It cannot be fractions.
    * Discrete Variables can be **finite** or **infinite**. While coin flips that result with heads can be infinite, but selecting aces from a pack of cards is finite.
  * **Continuous Variable** - variables that be any value within a range. For example the height of a person selected from a population is continuous.
* **Probability Distribution** a table or equation that can describe every outcome and its probability of occurance.
  * **Discrete** - a distribution that can be represented by a table. For example, there are only 4 outcomes from flipping a coin 2 times.

    | Number of Heads, x | Probability P(x) |
    |--------------------|------------------|
    | 0                  | 0.25             |
    | 1                  | 0.5              |
    | 2                  | 0.25             |
