# Hypothesis Testing

Example: a scientist is testing the reaction time of rats to a stimulus. The average reaction time of a rat is 1.2. The scientist injects 100 rats with a drug, and for those rats, the average reaction time is 1.05 seconds, with a standard deviation of 0.5 seconds. Does the drug have an effect?
