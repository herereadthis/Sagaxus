# Bayesian Programming

Notes from Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers

* Measure probability in terms of the believability of an event. How confident are we the event will occur?


## Example

* What is the probability the application has no bugs, given the results of the debugging test?

  * Let Tests be <em>A</em> and let the probability of no bugs be <em>B</em>
