# Frequentist Statistics

* Everyone uses Bayes' Theorem when the the prior *P(H)* is known
* If there is no prior, then we draw inferences from the likelihood function.
* **Frequentist** - the idea that probabilities present long-term frequencies of repeatable random experiments.
  * Don't use probabilities to quantify degree of belief in hypotheses, so no pdf
* Difference
  * Bayesian statistics will put probability distributions on hypotheses and data. Probability is belief
  * Frequentist statistics will put probability on the experimental data. Probability comes from experiments
* **Point Statistic** - a single value computed from data, such as mean or maximum
* **Interval Statistic** - interval computed from data, such as range
* **Set Statistic** - a set computed from data. Suppose we have bunch of dice, and each dice has different n sides. Data can be the value of the roll of 1 die picked at random. The Set is determined from the value. If it is 20, obviously the 6-sided die is not part of the set.
* **Sampling Distribution** - the probability distribution of the statistic
* **Point Estimate** - using statistics to get paramater *&theta;*
