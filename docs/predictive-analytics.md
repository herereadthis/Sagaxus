# Predictive Analytics

Predictive analytics for providing stragetic insights.

## Qualifying Leads
* **Predictive Scoring**
  * analyze how leads are responding to marketing attempts and how likely they will do something
  * identify which leads to focus on, which leads to let go
* **Identificaiton models**
  * compare leads to customers who have done something in the past.
  * divert resources to leads who are most promising based on past actions
  * identify new markets?
* **Personalization**
  * determine which leads respond best to which types of messaging
  * personalized segmenting is better than splitting leads into groups


## Cluster models

Segment customers into groups based on looking for correlations between various attributes. Clustering differs from traditional segmentation because it uses a lot more variables

* Product clusters: customers who only buy specific types of products, ignoring everything else in a catalog
* Brand clusters: those who only buy from specific brands
* Behavioral clusters: customers with a specific collection of behaviors, such as those who frequently make small orders instead of infrequent large orders

## Propensity models


Make future predictions about customer behavior based on behavior and attributes. Examples

* Propensity to churn: otherwise high value customers who are likely to leave if no action is taken
* Propensity to unsubscribe: determine email frequency
* Lifetime value: make marketing decisions to create customers with extended value

## Collaborative filtering

Make recommendations based on aggregate behavior, aka Amazon's "customers who like this product also...." Not about a user's preferences, but behaviors that products tend to cause

* Up-sellling - recommend a higher-tier product before the sale is made
* Cross-selling - recommend something that is bought at the same time before a sale is made
* Follow-up selling - recommend things that people tend to buy after a period of time after buying a product
