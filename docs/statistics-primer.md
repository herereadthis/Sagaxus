# Statistics Primer

The goal of statistics is to make inferences based on data.

1. Collect the data
2. Describe the data
3. Analyze the data

* **Statistic** - anything that can be computed from collected data
  * Is a coin fair if it lands 60 heads out of 100 tosses?
* **Probability** - the likelihood that an event occurs
  * What is the likelihood of landing 60 heads out of 100 coin tosses
